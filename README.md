# Final Project - Inventory Item Tracker

# Inventory Item Tracker

## ðŸ‘¤ Student: Adakhan Begimkulov

## ðŸ“Œ Description
The **Inventory Item Tracker** is a Java-based command-line application that allows users to efficiently manage a collection of inventory items. This application provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality and stores all data in a readable CSV file for persistence between sessions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Implement a user-friendly inventory management system via the command-line interface.
- Enable users to add, view, update, and delete inventory items.
- Ensure data is persistently stored in a human-readable format (`data.csv`) using CSV serialization.
- Validate user input to prevent incorrect or empty values.
- Provide summary reports, such as total number of items and total inventory value.
- Design the program in a modular, maintainable, and readable way using object-oriented principles.
- Handle errors gracefully to avoid crashes during unexpected input or file issues.

## âœ… Requirements

1. **CRUD Functionality**  
   Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for inventory items.

2. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**  
   Provide a simple and clear menu-driven interface for user interaction through the terminal.

3. **Input Validation**  
   Prevent empty inputs and ensure numeric fields (e.g., quantity, price) are valid.

4. **Data Persistence**  
   Save and load inventory data to and from a `data.csv` file to preserve changes between sessions.

5. **Readable Data Format**  
   Store data in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format to allow external viewing and editing.

6. **Item Identification**  
   Each inventory item must have a unique ID to differentiate it from others.

7. **Summary Report Generation**  
   Generate a report displaying total number of items and total inventory value.

8. **Error Handling**  
   Gracefully handle file I/O errors, invalid inputs, and operations on non-existent items.

9. **Modular Design**  
   Divide the code into logical, reusable classes (e.g., `InventoryItem`, `InventoryManager`, `ReportGenerator`, `Utils`).

10. **Documentation**  
    Include clear in-code comments and a `README.md` file explaining the project structure, functionality, and usage instructions.
